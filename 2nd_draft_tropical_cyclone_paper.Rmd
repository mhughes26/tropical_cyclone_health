# Introduction

Tropical cyclones---which encompasses hurricanes as well as tropical storms and tropical depressions--- regularly threaten coastal communities across the Eastern and Southern United States. From 2000 to 2019, tropical cyclones cost the United States at least 811 billion dollars in damages[@NOAA billion dollar disasters]. Tropical cyclones in that same time frame resulted in 6,010 human fatalities, averaging 301 deaths per year [@NOAA billion dollar disasters]. Tropical cyclones upset coastal communities and society by damaging property, disrupting local economies, and harming human health. This is why they are so critical to study. 

Tropical cyclones are environmental disaster events that are crucial for public health authorities and scientists to understand. Human mortality is an obvious consequence of these storms, and in 1992 Hurricane Andrew left 53 residents in Florida and surrounding states dead [@ahrens2005essentials]. However, many other chronic and long term health impacts have been observed in the aftermath of tropical cyclones. For example, researchers have observed that in utero exposure to tropical cyclones leads to adverse birth outcomes. [@kinney2008autism] observed higher rates of autism in children born to mothers who had higher rates of storm exposure than children born to mothers who were exposed to later intensities. This is not very surprising when one considers that tropical storms are highly stressful events, and stress during a pregnancy is known to have strong impacts on the developing fetus. The scientific literature also reveals evidence of mental health outcomes associated with populations exposed to tropical cyclones. Survivors of tropical storms often report higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, due to reduced access to important medical and social services, property damages, poor sanitation, and displacement after storms [@lieberman2017self]. 

Beyond health impacts, both mental and physical, tropical storms create incredible strains on the economies of the Southeastern United States. The average cost of a tropical cyclone event in the US is 21.2 billion per event. [@NOAA billion dollar disasters]. Large population displacements often result from tropical cyclone events as well, such as the migration of Puerto Ricans to Florida after Hurricane Maria. [@scaramutti2019mental]

Clearly, tropical cyclones dramatically impact the social, economic, and physical wellbeing of  coastal communities. These extreme weather events represent an environmental health threat that is not going to disappear, and given that coastal regions of the Southeastern US are experiencing population growth, it is likely that higher numbers of people will be put at risk in the future. Avoiding these risks is not possible, but building resilience in communities after they experience tropical cyclone events is key to mitigating damages and preparing for future disasters. Creating lasting and resilient communities in areas prone to tropical cyclones  requires that researchers understand which populations and locations are at the greatest risk for negative exposures to tropical storms. High quality data allows researchers to assess where in space and time tropical storms occur, and also where in space and time individuals and populations are experiencing impacts from these storms. 

Multidisciplinary teams of researchers are exploring this using different datasets, however a key challenge is integrating data from across disciplines. For example: extensive physical exposure data is often available for tropical cyclones as they near and cross communities in the United States. This data can come both from established monitoring networks, like [NOAA network name?], but may also result from data collection efforts during or after the storm by atmospheric scientists and engineers seeking to characterize a storm. Researchers studying the human impacts of these storms, including epidemiologists, economists, and social scientists are interested in this data as well, but the differences in temporal and spatial resolution makes the data accessible harder to use. Resolving physical exposure and human impact datasets is challenging because the human impact data and physical exposure data often do not have congruent resolutions. 

Here we explore cases and implications of integrating data at different temporal and spatial scales, focusing as an example on human impact studies of tropical cyclones in the US. We begin by investigating the reasons that spatial and temporal misaligment exist in the study of tropical cyclones. We then describe the main spatial and temporal scales used, and finally assess some of the consequences that result from integrating physical exposure data with human impacts data.
