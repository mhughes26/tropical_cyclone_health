- Epidemiological studies require a measure of health outcome and one or more potential explanatory variables for each study subject. Explanatory variables can be divided into variables of interest and potential confounders. 
- "The true exposure is denoted T and the approximate measure X, and the error E, with:
    X = T + E.
    The SD of T, X, and E are written óT, óX, and óE respectively ." [@armstrong1998effect]
- Non-differential error always biases effects towards the null and the extent of bias is dependent on the specificity and sensitivity of classification as well as the proportion of truly diseased people among the non-diseased.  
- "All types of non-differential random measurement error or misclassification reduce study
power—the chance that a study will find a significant association if one is truly present." [@armstrong1998effect]
- Confounding
- Coefficient or reliability
- Putative modifier
