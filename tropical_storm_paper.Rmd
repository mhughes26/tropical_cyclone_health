# Introduction

Tropical cyclones---which encompasses hurricanes as well as tropical storms and tropical depressions---are a pervasive threat to communities across the Eastern and Southern United States. These storms originate in the North Atlantic Basin, which produced 16 category 4 and 5 hurricanes alone, between 1975 and 1989, and 25 hurricanes of similar intensity between 1990 and 2004 [@webster2005changes]. Furthermore, there have been 37 years since 1900 that hurricanes caused damages worth more than 10 billion dollars, and this is projected to grow as coastal regions experience population growth, increased wealth, and warmer sea temperatures [@klotzbach2018continental]. As of July 8, 2020, damages from tropical cyclones have cost $1,004 billion and resulted in 7,555 deaths since 1980 [@NOAA billion dollar disasters]. The destructive nature of tropical cyclones creates an imperative to study their human impacts, which includes property damage, monetary loss, and negative health outcomes. 

Researchers have observed that in utero exposure to tropical cyclones leads to adverse birth outcomes. [@kinney2008autism] observed higher rates of autism in children born to mothers who had higher rates of storm exposure than children born to mothers who were exposed to later intensities. This is not very surprising when one considers that tropical storms are highly stressful events, and stress during a pregnancy is known to have strong impacts on the developing fetus. [@grabich2016hurricane] was another paper that looked at birth outcomes after tropical storms. The researchers in this case found a positive association between exposure to a hurricane and the risk of a pre-term birth. 

The scientific literature also reveals evidence of mental health outcomes associated with populations exposed to tropical cyclones. Survivors of tropical storms often report higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, due to reduced access to important medical and social services, property damages, poor sanitation, and displacement after storms. [@lieberman2017self] found higher levels of PTSD in New York City residents who were exposed to flooding after Hurricane Sandy. [@bevilacqua2020understanding] also found higher levels of PTSD, as well as probable depression and anxiety among residents with a higher Hurricane Exposure Score in Houston, Texas. Displaced Puerto Ricans living in Florida after Hurricane Maria also exhibited higher rates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD[@scaramutti2019mental]. These mental health outcomes were compared to Puerto Ricans living on the island, and the individuals who had migrated reported higher frequencies of mental health problems than those who had not. Displacement after a tropical storms is a common human impact that leads to other mental health effects, as well as economic, social, and environmental effects. 

Beyond health impacts, both mental and physical, tropical storms create incredible strains on the economies of the Southeastern United States. These costs are expected to grow as climate change intensifies extreme weather events. It is estimated that by 2100, damages caused by extreme weather events will cost the United States $19 billion. [@narita2009damage]. Tropical cyclones often disrupt local economies of coastal communities. For example, in Florida, hurricanes lead to demand shocks in the economy with a positive net effect on earnings and negative net effect on employment - counties directly hit by hurricanes experienced up to 4.35% increases in earnings and 4.76% decreases in employment [@belasen2008hurricanes]. This confusing paradox makes sense when one considers that while hurricanes may wipe out local businesses, the post-hurricane recovery period boosts certain businesses and sectors. New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is evidence of this. While the city initially experienced the negative effects of a shut down economy, several years after the storm revealed that victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans experienced increased income relative to cities not affected by the storm, perhaps due to a strengthed labor market in post-Katrina New Orleans [@deryugina2018economic]. High costs of rebuilding infrastructure, providing resources to displaced populations, medical bills, and loss of businesses after a tropical storm all drive these economic burdens. 

Clearly there are severe human impacts that result from exposure to tropical storms. One of the best ways to mitigate impacts is to understand which populations and locations are at a greatest risk for exposure to tropical storms. This requires data that allows researchers to assess where in space and time tropical storms occur, and also where in space and time individuals and populations are experiencing impacts from these storms. 

Lots of researchers are exploring this using multidisciplinary teams, however a key challenge is integrating data from across disciplines. For example: Extensive physical exposure data is often available for tropical cyclones as they near and cross communities in the United States. This data can come both from established monitoring networks, like [NOAA network name?], but may also result from data collection efforts during or after the storm by atmospheric scientists and engineers seeking to characterize a storm. Researchers studying the human impacts of these storms, including epidemiologists, economists, and social scientists are interested in this data as well, but it is often unavailable in a way that is accessible for them to use. Resolving physical exposure and human impact datasets is challenging because the human impact data and physical exposure data do not have congruent resolutions. 

Here we explore cases and implications of integrating data at different temporal and spatial scales, focusing as an example on human impact studies of tropical cyclones in the US. We begin by investigating the reasons that spatial and temporal misaligment exist in the study of tropical cyclones. We then describe the main spatial and temporal scales used, and finally assess some of the consequences that result from integrating physical exposure data with human impacts data. 

# Spatial and Temporal Misalignment: Origins of Integration Challenges

Spatial and temporal misalignment is a problem that researchers run into when integrating data from human impact studies with physical exposure data. For example, physical exposure data on windspeed may have a very fine resolution, possibly down to seconds or minutes, while data on birth outcomes may be at a temporal scale of weeks or even months. 

Some of the reasons for this are practical. Often physical exposure data is recorded at monitoring systems that are designed to automatically record a data point at a fixed interval of time. Human impact data on health or socioeconomic status comes from administrative sources that collect data on certain scales. Different sources of data naturally beget differences in data resolution. Another factor that drives spatial and temporal misalignment between physical exposure data and human impacts data is privacy. Physical exposure data is impersonal and can often represent a very specific temporal and spatial point, whereas human impacts data is often aggregated to preserve the anonymity and privacy of study subjects. 

The study question that researchers ask may also drive the choice of spatial and temporal scales used to understand human impacts from tropical cyclones. If a study is concerned with birth outcomes for example, having weather data on the windspeed every several seconds may not be relevant, because birth outcomes related to storm exposure in utero may operate on a longer time scale. Sometimes exposure to a tropical cyclone is defined as being present in a county that was hit by the storm center during a gestational period of a mother's pregnancy as is the case in [@grabich2016hurricane]. Here, the researchers divided a pregnancy into exposed and unexposed time to tropical cyclones after 20 weeks of gestation. Using cumulative storm data therefore gives the researchers an easier way to integrate physical exposure data with the gestational period being studied. 

Another factor that drives spatial and temporal misalignment in tropical cyclone studies is that researchers studying human impacts often do not collect the physical exposure data themselves. Instead they get this data from large sources of secondary data such as the National Hurricane Center Data Archive from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and the NWS (National Weather Service). Researchers also will use such secondary datasets and sources to compare with primary data sources. For example in [@lieberman2017self], self reported flooding exposure data was compared to FEMA flooding exposure data.

A review of the literature on human impacts of tropical cyclone shows that certain spatial and temporal scales show up more frequently than others. Spatially, county level and zip code level data are frequently used to aggregate health outcomes and other human impacts. Temporal scales for human impact studies are often cumulative measures of time. This is in contrast to physical exposure data which is often spatially at the point location level, and temporally at a very fine resolution down to minutes and seconds. 

In this paper, we will illustrate some some of the situations where various spatial and temporal levels of physical exposure data are used, using examples from the literature. These examples will demonstrate different ways that researchers have integrated physical exposure data with human impacts data. We will discuss how differences in
resolution between physical exposure and human impact datasets can create challenges in measuring and inferring the association between tropical cyclone exposure and human impacts. Finally, we will explore some of the implications of integrating these different types of data. 

# Spatial Scales

The spatial scale that a researcher uses varies depending on the data available or sampling method used. In human impacts data finer spatial scales will correspond more often to individuals or households, while larger spatial scales will correspond to regions, states, or even countries. Physical exposure data is often at a small point location or a grid, based on where weather monitoring sensors are placed. In the following section we will outline the most common spatial scales used in tropical cyclone studies and include some examples from the literature where they were employed. 

### Point Location

[BA: Let's think some about the order we want for these sections. We're making
several good points / analysis here. First, we're defining what we mean by the
resolution ("point location" here). We probably want to start with that. Then we
have some examples for studies that have had outcome data at this resolution.
Maybe that could go next, to help illustrate the definition we've given. We've
got some information on *how* the data at this scale was collected (e.g.,
geocoding from addresses reported from the study subjects), which I think is
really interesting. Finally, we're got some text that talks about how data at
this resolution could be integrated with some main formats of exposure data. We
might want to end with that (or maybe even, as we work on this draft, that might
go into a different section of the paper).]

Point locations are the smallest resolution of spatial data used to assess the exposure to tropical storms and hurricanes, as they represent the specific location of individual, non-aggregated observations on the outcome of interest. In many cases, researchers collect information on the study subject's residential address through some sort of a survey to assess point location  [@lieberman2017self], [@jaycox2010children],[@bayleyegn2006rapid]. These surveys are often designed to assess psychological needs of hurricane survivors, as well as medical, financial, and nutritional needs. For example in [@lieberman2017self], New York City residents provided their address in a self reported manner to look at associations between mental health outcomes and flooding data. This residential address served as a point location that could be mapped and was compared to flooding data maps created by FEMA.  In other cases, a GPS device is used to record coordinates that mark a specific point location. An example is [@hagy2006effects], where specific point locations were used to take water samples were taken to measure parameters of water quality such as salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity compared before and after Hurricane Ivan in Pensacola Bay, Florida. This is a common practice in ecological research because point locations distributed across a landscape can be used to observe patterns taking geography into account. Point locations are also advantageous when using satellite images in conjuction with analysis of hurricane impact as illustrated in [@bianchette2009ecological], where Landsat 5 images were used to compare vegetation damage, by looking at specific trees at different elevations to assess the ecological impact of Hurricane Ivan. 

The obvious advantage of a point location is that when mapped, it can be overlayed with physical exposure data on a storm or storms to gage a very accurate picture of exposure, taking full advantage of high resolution in the exposure data. Since storm tracks are often spatially represented by the path of the storm's center, having point locations for the exposed units of interest allows researchers to more accurately measure how close each observation was to the storm's central track, and make further conclusions on this. Similarly, point locations can be integrated in a straightforward way with gridded exposure data, as might result from re-analysis datasets or ... [check with James Done about this], as each point location can be assigned the exposure level of the closest gridded measurement.

[Once we give examples, we should talk about what level the physical exposure data was recorded as. Did it line up exactly? Grided data. Some studies avoid the problem by creating a proxy (ex: dist from the storm track).]

### Zip Code/County/Parish

While point locations are very useful, many of the papers cited used larger geographic areas to denote spatial exposure to storms. Zip codes [@bevilacqua2020understanding],[@lane2013health], are often used to aggregate groups of people living in a given area. Counties are at a higher aggregation level than zip codes [@kinney2008autism], [@grabich2016hurricane], [@grabich2016measuring], [@schwartz2018preliminary], [@harville2010population]. Often these levels seem to be used when a specific metropolitan area is being looked at, such as New York City after Hurricane Sandy [@lane2013health], and Houstan after Hurricane Harvey [@schwartz2018preliminary]. The county level is a convenient method to use the storm path of the hurricane to quickly categorize exposed areas as in [@grabich2016measuring]. 

There are several disadvantages and pitfalls to using this spatial level. For one, not all counties and zip codes(which are called parishes in Louisiana) are the same size or have the same population, so they may not be immediately comparable. Using the county/parish or zip code makes it easier for researchers to misclassify exposure. There are many ways that this can occur in a study on tropical storms; one common example is that counties selected as exposed are those that had the center of the storm pass through their county's physical boundaries. However it is very possible that some individuals lived in a county classified as exposed based on this criteria, but were in a region of the county far enough away from the storm center that they were not severely impacted. These individuals would be classified as exposed when they really were not and it could bias an apparetn association towards the null. Alternatively, individuals who lived in a unexposed county, but were near the border of an exposed county could be incorrectly categorized as being unexposed even if they actually experienced many of the effects of the storm. 

### State/Metropolitan Region

Many studies used the spatial level of entire states or specific metropolitan areas to gather information on those who were exposed. [@harville2010population] is an interesting paper because it looks at the state level as well as the regional and parish level. In this paper researchers observed birth outcomes in response to Hurricane Katrina in the state of Louisiana as a whole, the New Orleans metropolitan area, and Orleans parish, which is the heart of New Orleans. Looking at these three levels is a way to compare different incident rates and other measures of associations across different spatial scales. 

The state or national level is the spatial level of an ecological study and can be useful to compare the emergency preparedness and policies of different states. The potential for the ecological bias is of course present when looking at this spatial scale however, which occurs when the outcomes on the population level (typically an average), do not represent the individual outcomes very well. 

# Temporal Scales

### Week

Week is a very common unit of time used to ascertain exposure, particularly for studies that are concerned with birth outcomes and gestation during hurricane exposure [@kinney2008autism], [@grabich2016hurricane], [@grabich2016measuring]. When the week of gestation is known, the timing that the hurricane makes landfall, or has its storm center pass through a county can be matched up to this week of gestation to identify possible "critical periods" of exposure during development. 

In the North Atlantic Basin, tropical cyclones typically occur between June and November, and so sometimes month to several month periods are used to aggregate the temporal exposure to them. 

### Cumulative Measures of Time

It is often the case that specific physical exposures are not considered in real time to ascertain human impacts. Instead, human impacts are assessed after the storm has passed, often noting the number of days or weeks that have passed since the hurricane made landfall. This method is common when assessing damages, recovery efforts, and when human impacts are self reported. 







# Implications of not improving this integration

Differences in resolution between exposure and outcome datasets create challenges in measuring and inferring the association between tropical cyclone exposure and human impacts. When researchers study the economic, social, and health impacts that tropical storms and hurricanes have in locales like the Gulf Coast of the United States, it is important to select an appropriate spatial and temporal scale to adequately classify exposure. Mis-matches in the spatial and temporal scale of exposure data versus outcome data creates challenges when measuring and inferring associations between tropical cyclone exposures and human impacts. This is a problem because it gives an inaccurate picture of how communities and individuals’ health are impacted by these storms.  Two potential implications are that this mis-match can introducing bias in estimated associations and that it can reduce precision in estimates of those associations.

*Misclassification error / measurement error.*
One pathway for problems is through misclassification / measurement error bias. Misclassification error occurs when exposure and outcome variables are measured in categories and the wrong category is assigned to a particular case/observation - for example when a case that is exposed is incorrectly categorized as unexposed. For researchers who study tropical storms, it is common to categorize exposures by declaring a county or parish as exposed or unexposed based on whether the storm track went through the county. Failure to classify exposure accurately allows misclassification bias to move the results of the study further from the true parameter (for example, classifying certain observations as exposed to a storm when they really 
were not, or vice-versa). Measurement error occurs when the variables being measured are continuous, such as the amount of precipitation or the wind speed that was measured during a tropical cyclone. 

*Non-differential misclassification error.*
Non-differential misclassification refers to misclassification of either the exposure or the outcome, that is unrelated to the other (Aschengrau and Seage 2013). Environmental epidemiology studies are often prone to non-differential misclassification error, because the methods of assessing exposure are not always congruent with the way that researchers conduct human impact studies. The effect of misclassifying exposures will often, though not always, bias the results of outcome towards the null (Armstrong 1998). In effect, this will weaken or obscure any associations that are present that the researcher may hope to observe in the data (Armstrong 1998).   **[Add an example from tropical cyclone impacts
studies of a case where you might get non-differential misclassification
error.]**

*Differential misclassification error.*
Differential misclassification error occurs when the misclassification of the outcome is related to the misclassification of the exposure or vice versa [@aschengrau2013essentials]. While non-differential misclassification often (though not always) has the effect of moving the observed association or parameter towards the null, differential misclassification can move the observation in either direction. Differential misclassification in tropical cyclone impact studies occurs often in self reported data as in [@lieberman2017self] where study subjects were asked to report their own flooding exposure and their mental health symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It is reasonable to believe that self perceived exposure to hurricane related flooding would not be independent from perceived negative mental health symptoms and thus potentially contribute to differential misclassification error in this situation.

*Dichotomizing continuous exposure measurements.*
Sometimes, researchers use an agreed upon threshold to split a continuous metric into a binary classification (exposed or unexposed). For example, a county may be classified as exposed or unexposed based on local winds exceeding a threshold (e.g. gale-force winds or higher). S.C. Grabich et al. 2016 classified hurricane exposure in a Florida county using maximum wind speed. Maximum wind speed is a continuous variable, but the study used binary categorizations to divide it into tropical wind speeds, classified as greater than 39 miles per hour, and hurricane wind speeds, classified as greater than 74 miles per hour. Florida counties experiencing maximum wind speeds below 39 miles per hour were considered unexposed. 

Researchers typically categorize dichotomize or categorize continuous variables in several situations for several reasons. They do this typically because it simplifies the data and allows for easier analysis and interpretation [@naggara2011analysis]. Additionally, it is very common in clinical settings to categorize continuous variables, for example hypertensive or not hypertensive, overweight or not overweight, dead or alive, etc. [@van2008leave]. 

Despite several advantages to dichotomizing continuous variables that we just discussed, the general consensus in epidemiology is not to do it. Statistical power is lost because so much information is lost when categorization occurs [@van2008leave]. This makes sense when you consider that continuous variables allow you to observe nuance in the data and perceive a dose response relationship between the predictor and response variables, should one exist. This effect is masked when researchers categorize data, and even more so when a smaller number of categorical variables are used (for example dichotomization itself at 2). Generally, if you are going to categorize continuous data, it is better to use 3 or more categories rather than just two. An example of a paper that used three different bins was [@kinney2008autism], which explored the risk of autism after a pregnancy that included exposure to a tropical storm in the state of Louisiana. The study authors classified tropical storm exposure as severe, intermediate, and low exposure, and these exposure classifications were determined based on whether a mother lived in a Louisiana parish that had both of the exposure factors of interest: storm intensity and storm vulnerability. Storm vulnerability in this case was based on another dichotomy: whether or not the storm center passed through the parish of interest. Storm vulnerability was a measure of how vulnerable the inhabitants of the parish were to the effects of a storm (higher socioeconomic neighborhoods and parishes have more resources to withstand and recover from a tropical storm for example). 

Another obvious problem with categorizing continuous data is that the cutoff points are often arbitrary. In the case of dichotomization, the median is often used, but there is typically no reason to assume that the median is a reasonable cutoff point. Because different samples will have different medians, this automatically makes many categorical bins difficult to compare across studies [@altman2006cost]. Further, choosing optimal cutoff points that give the smallest p-values can lead to spurious results [@altman2006cost]. 

Not surprisingly, dichotomizing continuous variables can bias results. A study by Selvin showed that the odds ratios can be significantly different depending on the chosen cutoff that is implemented in a study [@van2008leave]. Categorical variables can also put otherwise similar observations into separate bins if they are close but on opposite sides of the cutoff [@altman2006cost].  Choosing a median as a cutoff is intended to delineate bins, but if the bins are a "high" and "low" group, two individual observations that may only be a fraction different, but on either sides of the mean, will be classified as high and low respectively, and give the false impression that they are significantly different.

While dichotomizing continuous variables is something that can be done for either the exposure or the outcome of interest in a study, for our purposes we are primarily interested in continuous *exposures*. This means that we are primarily interested in the effects of dichotomizing variables such as wind speed, rainfall, temperature, distance from storm center, and distance from coastline, among other factors. Many epidemiology studies will dichotomize continuous outcome variables such as blood pressure, body weight (BMI), and length of pregnancy in order to gage medical concern and priorities, but because we are concerend with creating a data framework that makes storm exposure data accessible for epidemiologists, exposure scientits, economists, and other scientists to use, we have a priority to look at exposure variables. 

*Scales for Categorizing Wind Speeds*
There are several methods in existence for categorizing wind speed, one of the most frequently used variables for estimating exposure to hurricanes and tropical storms. The first is the Saffir-Simpson scale, which uses five different bins to classify varying levels of wind speed and determine the severity of a storm. The first level, Category 1 is designated for hurricanes and tropical storms with maximum wind speeds of between 64 - 82 knots and is generally considered dangerous to people, livestock, and pets from the hazard of flying and falling debris [@taylor2010saffir]. On the higher end of the scale, Category 5 designates hurricanes with maximum wind speeds above 137 knots and is considered to have catastrophic effect on damage and a high probability of injury or death to people, livestock, and pets even if they are sheltering indoors [@taylor2010saffir]. 

Forecasters classify hurricanes into categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on maximum sustained surface wind speed. This is defined as the peak one minute wind speed at a height of 10 feet over an unobstructed exposure [@taylor2010saffir]. An important limitation of the Saffir-Simpson scale is that it doesn't account for other hurricane-related impact variables such as storm surges, flooding, and tornadoes [@taylor2010saffir]. 

Another scale used to categorize wind speed is the Beaufort scale, created by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort, used to classify wind speeds both over land and sea. While the Saffir-Simpson scale is only designated for wind speeds that are already at hurricane levels (greater than 64 knots), the Beaufort scale considers the wind speeds below this. The scale ranges from Force 0 (0-1 knots and calm) to Force 12 (64 to 71 knots and hurricane). Other interesting parts of the scale include Force 3 (4-6 knots) which is a gentle breeze, and Force 8 (34-40 knots) which is considered a gale. 

Categorizing wind speeds presents researchers with some of the same problems mentioned above that happen when dealing with continuous data, but both scales are based off associations between winds at certain speeds and observed damage and health impacts to communities exposed to these wind speeds.

*Aggregate Hurricane Exposure Metrics*

Another method of assessing damage and impact of tropical storms and hurricanes is through a single aggegrate exposure metric. While aggregate values often represent the mean of all the values recorded, weather data is typically assessed by the maximum value. This could be something like the maximum wind speed reached in a particular county or parish, or the total monetary cost in damage due to flooding in a metropolitan statistical area. The Saffir-Simpson scale is an example of how entire storms are often classified by their maximum wind speed. 

Although using a single exposure value can simplify analysis and interpretation, particularly over an extended temporal scale, there are some obvious drawbacks to relying on one single aggregate value. For example, the Saffir Simpson categories typically correspond only to the geographic point location where the maximum wind speed was observed [@taylor2010saffir]. Hurricane Wilma in 2005 for example, was a Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall on the southwest coast of Florida, but it created Category 1 and Category 2 conditions for the more populous Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties when it finally reached them [@taylor2010saffir].

Single exposure metrics are often used after a storm event has happened. They are very common in assessing ecological damage after a large hurricane. 

*Ecological Bias/The Ecological Fallacy*
Because studying tropical storm and hurricane exposures requires us to look at different spatial scales, we run the risk of encountering the ecological bias when looking at larger spatial aggregations. Ecological bias occurs whenever the aggregate association between an exposure and an outcome does not properly reflect the association on the individual level [@greenland1989ecological]. Ecological studies themselves don't look at individuals, but rather at an aggregate value, usually within a defined geographic region. Looking at national levels of obesity, cancer, or life expectancy, and comparing countries with respect to these outcomes and some exposure is an example of what ecological studies aim to achieve. 

An example of a study that could be prone to this kind of bias is [@kinney2008autism] where Louisiana parishes were considered vulnerable to hurricane exposure based on whether or not the storm center passed through that parish. It is possible that the cases considered exposed based on living in these parishes were not in fact exposed since the storm may have passed through only a certain part of the parish. Never the less, all cases in a parish are considered exposed or unexposed in the aggregate. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[BA: I'm adding some additional text/notes we can work into Claim 2 as
appropriate. I drafted these while working on another manuscript but they 
were more detailed than we needed there, so we can work them in here.]

Measurement error can be either random or systematic. Systematic error can often
be corrected with adjustment if the direction and typical size of the error is
understood. Random error cannot in the same way. Either type of measurement
error can be either differential (associated with the probability of the
outcome) or non-differential (independent of the distribution / probability of
the outcome). In simpler models, this characteristic might help in predicting
whether the resulting bias is likely toward the null; however, more complex
models (e.g., statistical models with adjustment for potential confounders) are
trickier to diagnose in terms of the likely implications of differential versus
non-differential measurement error [would need a ref for this].

When a single value of exposure is assigned across an aggregated level (e.g., a
single exposure measurement for a county or ZIP code), it assumes constant
exposure across that area. However, this will typically not be the
case---hazards like storm-associated wind, rain, and flooding can vary in
intensity across these spatial areas. For some hazards, this variation can be
notable. Storm surge, for example, will typically be limited to coastal areas of
a county or ZIP code. Other hazards, like storm-associated wind and rain, are
more likely to be more homogeneous across space, and so have less
within-county/ZIP code variation. The rainfields for tropical cyclones are very
large, and while there are rainbands within the storm that might have
particularly high rates of precipitation, these progress over the course of the
storm, and it is unlikely that a county will have one area that experienced very
extreme precipitation while another experienced very little [BA: We could see if
we could find a good ref. or two on this point]. Similarly, while topographic
features and other variability can create variation in the sustained and gust
windspeeds experienced in an area from a storm, it is unlikely that one part of
a county would experience high-impact winds from a storm while other parts of
the county experienced mild wind [BA: We could look for a ref for this, too].

If you use a single exposure estimate for everyone in an area, there is the
chance that some people within that area will be misclassified (if exposure is
measured as exposed/unexposed) or have exposure measured with error (if a
continuous metric of exposure is being used), unless the exposure is perfectly
homogeneous across the area. This exposure misclassification or measurement
error can lower the power of the study to detect a clear association between
exposure to a storm hazard and a certain societal impact, as this smoothing
drops information inherent in the within-county variation in exposure levels. It
can also bias estimates of the association between exposure and outcome in the
same way exposure misclassification through any other mechanism would.

When a proxy exposure estimate (e.g., county-level average exposure level) is
used for a group of individuals in the study, it can result in a type of 
exposure measurement error called Berkson error. In this case, the true
exposure of each individual is randomly distributed around the proxy or 
mean exposure level assigned to him or her. In other words, the group as a 
whole is assigned a common exposure level, based on the average exposure 
across that group, when in fact the individuals' true exposure levels are 
randomly distributed around this common assigned exposure level. [BA: I think
this type of error might be a risk when aggregating exposure data, but we should
look into it a bit more to make sure I'm right.]

It can be important to think about the scale at which the process happens. For
something very local (e.g., aggregating to a very small neighborhood scale),
much less information will be lost compared to aggregated to a large scale
(e.g., state). If an exposure tends to be fairly homogenous across the spatial
scale used for aggregation, then these concerns are lessened
[@wakefield2008overcoming].

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data that are aggregated across a spatial area---for example, the total number
of deaths in a geographic area in a certain time period---is known as ecological 
data, aggregate data, or contextual-level data. Studies that use such data are 
known as ecological studies [@sedgwick2014ecological].

Aggregated or ecological data can be used to infer a contextual effect, for
example. Sometimes, however, aggregated data are used to infer individual-level
associations. While the first type of inference seeks to answer questions like
how the county-wide rate of an outcome of interest changes when the county is
exposed to a storm hazard, the second seeks to determine how a person's
individual risk of an outcome changes if he or she is personally exposed to the
hazard. The second type of inference can be prone to bias that results from
cross-level inference---the data used to model the association is at the
contextual level (e.g., county-level) while the inference is for the individual
association between exposure and outcome. When an individual-level association
is estimated from ecological data, the estimate can be very biased from the true
association, event to the point of reversing the effect estimate---estimating a
protective effect, for example, when the true effect is detrimental
[@wakefield2008overcoming]. This type of bias is called ecological  or
cross-level bias [@greenland1994invited; @idrovo2011three], and the
misconception that associations estimated from data at the ecological/aggregated
level provide an unbiased estimate of individual-level associations between
exposure and risk of the outcome is called the ecological fallacy
[@wakefield2006health; @portnov2007ecological].

Ecological bias can result both from individual-level exposure measurement error
inherent in assigning a common exposure estimate to everyone in an area, while
the exposure varies in intensity across that area. It can also result from
confounding, even if the confounders are controlled at the ecological level.
When data are aggregated across a spatial area, information is lost about how
all relevant factors---exposure level, outcome risk, confounders, and even
potential effect modifiers---vary within that spatial area. Just as aggregation
smooths over within-area variation in exposure levels, it also smooths over
within-area variation in levels of potential confounders. Depending on the
patterns of this within-area variation, a result could be that ecological-level
control of the confounders does not, in fact, control for their role at the
individual level, and so the association inferred at the ecologic level
continues to be confounded by them when inferred to the individual level.  In
other words, a factor could still confound the inference of an individual-level
association, even if it is controlled at a population level in an ecological
model. For example, a study of the association between risk of pre-term birth
and tropical cyclone exposure could control for county-level smoking when
modeling county-level storm exposure and county-level rates of pre-term births.
Even with this control, an observed association could result from differences in
individual smoking status, if there is within-county variation in smoking and if
this has a different pattern across people in the county than variation in
exposure from the county-wide exposure estimate.

If individual-level inference is the aim, and population-level data is
available, there are some methods for using it while still aiming to avoid
ecological bias. Indeed, it can be helpful to use population-level data, as it
is often available for a large population, improving the power and precision of
the study [@wakefield2008overcoming; @wakefield2006health]. Further, the level
of exposure might vary a lot more over the population captured with
population-level data compared to the variation that captured in a smaller
sample of individual-level data [@wakefield2008overcoming]. This can contribute
both to statistical power and improve external validity (as the study data will
cover more of the range of exposure that might ever be expected). There are
ways, for example, to supplement population-level data with samples of
individual-level data through two-level, semi-ecologic study designs
[@wakefield2008overcoming]. Other study designs can also be used to leverage
ecological data while minimizing risk from ecological bias. For example,
potential confounders like age distribution and smoking rates vary much less
within a county over time than comparing between counties. Time series-style
study designs, which compare a county to itself over time, therefore allow for
very similar covariate distributions between exposure and non-exposure. This can
help since the mechanism for ecological bias depends on the joint distribution
between individual exposure, outcome, and covariates, if any are included in the
model. Other studies add to this design by stabilizing for temporal confounding
through the addition of counties that were never exposed, allowing for a
differences-in-differences style approach to calibrate for seasonal or
longer-term trends that might otherwise create confounding. For example, many
health outcomes have a strong seasonal trend, with peak rates in the winter and
lows in the summer. Since the hurricane season stretches from summer into fall,
a study design that compares the rate of a health outcome in an exposed county
to the rate two weeks before the exposure might be biased away from the null,
since baseline rates of the health outcome will typically be moving up over most
of the hurricane season.

Ecological bias can also complicate estimation of effect modification, which 
otherwise could help in identifying vulnerabilities and susceptibilities among
certain subpopulations [@wakefield2008overcoming].

For disasters, there are added nuances. First, in some cases, the ecologic-level
effect (contextual effect) will be directly of interest. For example, public
health planners in a city may be more interested in knowing how a storm hazard
exposure is likely to change city-wide rates of certain outcomes than in how it
would change individual-level risk. In this case, it is appropriate to use of
ecologic-level data, and resulting estimates will not be prone to ecological
bias) [@idrovo2011three; @greenland1994invited], although when inferring
contextual effects from ecologic data without considering individual-level
factors, there is a chance for the *sociologistic fallacy* [@idrovo2011three].

from the @idrovo2011three reference].

Second, for a disaster, the relevant exposure might be not just at the individual level
(e.g., winds or flooding at the individual's residence), but also throughout a
broader area surrounding the individual. Disasters bring physical hazards that
can harm people directly, but also through indirect pathways. The causal
pathways for tropical cyclones to affect human health and cause other societal
impacts therefore differ from those for a dangerous substance, like air
pollutants, in which the substance itself must enter the body to cause harm.
While some health risk comes directly from the storm (e.g., deaths and injuries
from trees falling on homes or drowning from flooding), there are many more
pathways that are indirect. These include pathways that go through the way that
the storm's damage affects community infrastructure and access to medical care.
For example, a tropical cyclone can bring high winds that cause power outages,
and as a result those affected could be exposed to more outdoor hazards (outdoor
air pollution, heat), struggle to safely store perishable food and medications,
and lose means to power medical equipment. While extreme winds at a person's
residence would increase their risk of a power outage, outages could also be
caused by damage to the grid in another part of the community. In some cases,
then, the level of exposure in a person's community may be as important in
opening a pathway of risk as exposure at the person's immediate location.

Finally, if the disaster has a large health impact, the health outcome of one
person in the community could affect the risk of the outcome (or other adverse
outcomes) for others. This situation is often only the case for infectious
diseases, where one person with the disease can spread it to others. However, if
the community-wide impact is large enough, it can affect access to and
effectiveness of medical care for everyone in the community. if hospitals in the
community are over capacity or have to evacuate, this could increase health risk
for people in a fairly large "catchment" area for that hospital. This effect has
been seen recently with Covid 19---attempts to "flatten the curve" aim to avoid
moving into a state where a community's health system becomes overwhelmed and
can no longer deliver a typical level of care to those in the community. This
effect could happen with either infectious or non-infectious diseases. Also,
there may be confounders that are relevant at the contextual, rather than
individual level, as well as modifiers. For example, whether the county is
coastal could be a contextual-level confounder and effect modifier. This will
influence whether the county is exposed to that storm or not, since storms
usually weaken rapidly when the center is over land. In terms of confounding
pathways, coastal communities might tend to have lower levels of air pollution,
because sea breezes clear the pollution regularly. They might also be wealthier
on average, since property on or near the beach is desirable. Finally, they
might be better prepared for or more hardened against tropical cyclones at the
community-wide level (e.g., through hardier power infrastructure, more rigorous
building codes, higher likelihood of evacuating in advance of a threatening
storm) compared to nearby inland counties.

When inferring individual-level associations from individual-level data, without
considering an additional role of ecological-level factors, this is known as the
*psychologistic* or *individualistic fallacy* [@idrovo2011three]. [BA: In this
last sentence, the cited article is a letter to the editor, and it in turn is
referencing some other papers that more fully define these ideas. If we keep
this, we should go back and read more deeply into those cited papers from the

# Terms

These are terms we're using right now that we might want to iterate on, 
in conjunction with our colleagues on the project, to make sure we have
terms that are precise and consistent across the document: 

- **physical exposure data**: By this, we mean things that are measured
about the storm like wind speed, rainfall, measures of flooding, and other
things that might be considered more in the realm of what an atmospheric
scientist or engineer might measure about the storm. We're contrasting 
this with data that for human impacts studies on outcomes among humans
(e.g., pregnancy outcomes, economic outcomes like unemployment)
- **resolution**: We're using this right now to talk about spatial and
temporal levels of aggregation. Sometimes, we're using "scales" instead, I 
think.
