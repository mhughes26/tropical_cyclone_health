  Hurricane Ivan surveys were taken October 6 and November 5, or 20 and
  50 days after the storm.\\

  Extent of inundated land and maximum height of tidal surge were

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Hurricane Ivan caused water to rise continuously for 31 hours.
\item
  Storm surge inundated 165 km\^{}2 of land, which increased the Bay's
  surface area by 50\% and it's volume by 230\%.
\item
  Based on Total Prism Model, storm surge flushed a maximum of 60\% of
  the Bay's water out to sea as it retreated - this must have increased
  salinity of the Bay substantially.
\item
  Using Navy's model estimate of offshore salinity in the Tidal Prism
  Model, Ivan's surge was computed to have increased the mean salinity
  of the Bay from 23.4 to as high as 30.0.
\item
  Tidal surge replaced Bay waters with low-nutrient, well-oxygenated,
  oligotrophic Gulf waters
\item
  Post-storm freshwater input stimulated an increase in phytoplankton
  biomass, which persisted for several weeks.
\item
  Hypoxia was intensified relative to the seasonal norm.

  Response variables of interest included birth weight, preterm birth,
  infant mortality, and mode of delivery.
\item
  Exposure to hurricanes increased odds of low birth weight and also
  increased risk for preterm birth, however it wasn't shown to have a
  significant association with increased infant mortality.

  Outcome of interest was mental health resilience of Hurricane Katrina
  and Rita survivors, stratified by vulnerability status. Number of poor
  mental health days used as metric for this.
\item
  Vulnerability status measured by poor physical health, social support,
  education level, income, and being a single mother.
\item
  Single mothers were identified as a particular vulnerability category
  of interest
\item
  ``Resistance refers to the capacity to limit displacement from
  equilibrium following a traumatic event. Resilience, by contrast,
  points to the ability to return to an equilibrium state---the more
  rapid the return to preevent functioning, the greater the
  resilience.'' (Zahran et al. 2011)
\item
  Average number of poor mental health days in 30 was 3.37 for the
  population as a whole, and 5.95 for single mothers.
\item
  Overall, hurricane exposed single mothers and exposed ``others'' all
  experienced an increased number of days of poor mental health.
\item
  ``We estimate that single mothers, as a group, suffered over \$130
  million in productivity loss from added postdisaster stress and
  disability.'' (Zahran et al. 2011)
